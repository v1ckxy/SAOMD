                     As of August 30, 2021, the online service of "SWORD ART ONLINE MEMORY DEFRAG" has ended.<br>
                     <br>
                     However, we, as a part of SAOMD community, are working on a project to bring back the game. If you are interested in the project, feel free to join our Discord server via this invite in the "Others" menu.<br> 
                     <br>
                     This is the beta version of our project, only the following contents are currently available:<br>
                     ・All stuffs from the base offline verison<br>
                     ・Almost all characters, equipments and events from the online verison, excluding stuffs from collaboration. (Monster Strike, Tales of the Rays, Persona 5 Royal)<br>
                     <br>
                     <small>※Available contents may be changed in the future.</small><br>

                  <p style="font-weight:bold;">■KNOWN ISSUES</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     ・Floor Clearing Events and its variants are unplayable.<br>
                     => We actually found the solution for this issue, however it requires a lot of time to fix them. We will try to fix normal FCEs as soon as possible.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・Guild Events and its variants require guild to play.<br>
                     => This is likely to be a feature, no fix for this one.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・The game sometimes has no sound.<br>
                     => Force close all background sounds before opening the game. This is the issue from online version so it is unlikely to be fixed.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・A black screen appears after "Link Start" screen and you can still tap in the game.<br>
                     => Restrat the game. This is a glitch from the vanilla offline version.<br>
                     <br>
