                     As of August 30, 2021, the online service of "SWORD ART ONLINE MEMORY DEFRAG" has ended.<br>
                     <br>
                     This is a modded version that brings back old units and events from the online version, with some custom contents that mostly made by <strong>Thyme-chan#2328</strong> (Discord) or <strong>@ThymechanGH</strong> (Twitter/YouTube).<br>
                     <br>
                     Patch note of this version could be found <a href="patch_note.html">here</a>.

                  <p style="font-weight:bold;">■KNOWN ISSUES</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     ・Floor Clearing Events and its variants are unplayable.<br>
                     => I could make them playable but it won't be the same as good old FCEs so NO.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・Guild Events and its variants require guild to play.<br>
                     => This is likely to be a feature, no fix for this one.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・The game sometimes has no sound.<br>
                     => Force close all background sounds before opening the game. This is the issue from online version so it is unlikely to be fixed.<br>
                     <br>
                     ・A black screen appears after "Link Start" screen and you can still tap in the game.<br>
                     => Restrat the game. This is a glitch from the vanilla offline version.<br>
